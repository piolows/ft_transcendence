# 42 Transcendence Project
## Final project of 42 Abu Dhabi Core Curriculum

This project focuses on creating an SPA (Single-Page Application) that provides you with the classic Pong game. The web application must be professionally made, well-secured and offer a good and smooth user experience.

The frontend is handled with Typescript and served using Vite.

The backend is handled through the combination of NodeJS and Fastify which will handle requests and process the HTTP Protocols.
